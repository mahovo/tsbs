\title{Compute Stationary Distribution of Markov Chain}
\usage{
compute_stationary_dist(trans_mat)
}
\arguments{
\item{trans_mat}{Square matrix of transition probabilities. Row i, column j
gives P(S_{t+1} = j | S_t = i). Rows must sum to 1.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of length K giving the stationary probabilities.
}
\description{
Computes the stationary (ergodic) distribution of a finite-state Markov chain
by solving \eqn{\pi P = \pi} subject to \eqn{\sum_k \pi_k = 1}.
}
\details{
Solves the system \eqn{(P' - I) \pi = 0} with the constraint \eqn{\sum \pi = 1}
by replacing one equation with the normalization constraint.
