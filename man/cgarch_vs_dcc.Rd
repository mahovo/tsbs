\subsection{When to Use CGARCH}{

Consider CGARCH when:
\itemize{
\item Non-normal marginal distributions are important
\item Tail dependence is a concern (use MVT copula)
\item Flexibility in marginal specification is needed
\item Semi-parametric transforms are preferred
}
}

\subsection{When to Use DCC}{

DCC may be preferable when:
\itemize{
\item Computational speed is critical
\item Normal margins are reasonable
\item Simpler model interpretation is desired
\item Analytical gradients for all parameters are needed
}
}

\subsection{Parameter Correspondence}{

Both models use α (shock response) and β (persistence) for dynamics.
ADCC adds γ (asymmetry) in both frameworks.

The shape parameter ν in MVT copula controls tail dependence:
\itemize{
\item Lower ν → stronger tail dependence
\item ν → ∞ → Gaussian copula (no tail dependence)
}
}
