\title{Raw Returns HMM Bootstrap (No GARCH)}
\usage{
.hmm_bootstrap_raw(
  x,
  n_boot = NULL,
  num_states = 2,
  num_boots = 100,
  distribution = "sstd",
  micro_block_length = 1L,
  regime_basis = "market",
  return_fit = FALSE,
  collect_diagnostics = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  seed = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector or matrix representing the time series.}

\item{n_boot}{Integer, length of each bootstrap series. If NULL, defaults to
the length of the original series.}

\item{num_states}{Integer, number of hidden states for the HMM. Default is 2.}

\item{num_boots}{Integer, number of bootstrap replicates to generate.
Default is 100.}

\item{distribution}{Character, emission distribution for the HMM. One of:
\describe{
\item{"gaussian"}{(Default) Gaussian emissions via depmixS4.
This is the original behavior.}
\item{"sstd"}{Skew Student-t via MSGARCH (with GARCH dynamics).}
\item{"std"}{Student-t via MSGARCH (with GARCH dynamics).}
\item{"snorm"}{Skew normal via MSGARCH (with GARCH dynamics).}
\item{"sged"}{Skew GED via MSGARCH (with GARCH dynamics).}
\item{"norm"}{Normal via MSGARCH (with GARCH dynamics).}
\item{"ged"}{GED via MSGARCH (with GARCH dynamics).}
\item{"sstd_raw"}{Skew Student-t without GARCH (standalone HMM-EM).}
\item{"std_raw"}{Student-t without GARCH (standalone HMM-EM).}
\item{"norm_raw"}{Normal without GARCH (standalone HMM-EM, equivalent
to depmixS4 but using our EM implementation).}
}}

\item{micro_block_length}{Integer, block length for within-state sampling
when using MSGARCH-based bootstrap. Use 1 (default) for iid sampling
within states, or >1 to preserve some local dependence. Ignored for
Gaussian distribution which uses the traditional block sampling.}

\item{regime_basis}{For multivariate data with MSGARCH: how to identify
regimes. One of \code{"market"} (equal-weighted average, default),
\code{"first_pc"} (first principal component), or an integer column index.
Ignored for Gaussian distribution.}

\item{return_fit}{Logical. If TRUE, returns the fitted model along with
bootstrap samples. Default is FALSE.}

\item{collect_diagnostics}{Logical. If TRUE, collects detailed diagnostic
information including regime composition. Default is FALSE.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints fitting information. Default is FALSE.}

\item{seed}{Integer, random seed for reproducibility. Default is NULL.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying fitting functions.}
