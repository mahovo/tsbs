\usage{
plot_regime_composition(
  tsbs_result,
  original_data,
  replicate_idx = 1,
  series_idx = 1,
  show_prices = TRUE,
  initial_price = 100,
  show_probabilities = FALSE,
  probability_style = c("ribbon", "line", "bands_alpha"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{tsbs_result}{A list returned by \code{tsbs()} with
\code{collect_diagnostics = TRUE}, or a \code{tsbs_diagnostics} object.}

\item{original_data}{The original data matrix used for bootstrapping.}

\item{replicate_idx}{Integer or vector of integers specifying which bootstrap
replicate(s) to plot. Default is 1 (first replicate).}

\item{series_idx}{Integer specifying which column/series to plot if
multivariate. Default is 1.}

\item{show_prices}{Logical. If TRUE and data appears to be returns, convert
to cumulative prices for visualization. Default is TRUE.}

\item{initial_price}{Numeric. Starting price for cumulative calculation.
Default is 100.}

\item{show_probabilities}{Logical. If TRUE, overlay smoothed state
probabilities on the plot instead of (or in addition to) discrete bands.
Requires that smoothed probabilities are available in the diagnostics.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{probability_style}{Character. How to display probabilities:
\itemize{
\item \code{"ribbon"}: Stacked ribbons showing probability of each state
\item \code{"line"}: Line plot of probability for each state
\item \code{"bands_alpha"}: Regime bands with alpha proportional to probability
}
Default is "ribbon".}

\item{show_bands}{Logical. If TRUE, show discrete regime bands. If
\code{show_probabilities = TRUE} and \code{show_bands = TRUE}, both are shown.
Default is TRUE when \code{show_probabilities = FALSE}.}

\item{state_colors}{Optional named vector of colors for each state.}

\item{title}{Optional plot title.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object (invisibly).
}
\description{
Creates a visualization comparing the original series with one or more
bootstrap replicates, showing the regime structure. Can display either
discrete regime bands or smoothed state probabilities.
}
\details{
This function creates a faceted plot with:
\itemize{
\item Top panel: Original series with regime information
\item Bottom panel(s): Bootstrap replicate(s) with their regime information
}

When \code{show_probabilities = TRUE}, the smoothed state probabilities from
the fitted model (HMM or MS-VARMA-GARCH) are displayed. This shows the
model's uncertainty about regime membership at each time point, which is
more informative than the hard Viterbi assignments.

For bootstrap replicates, the "probabilities" shown are actually the
probabilities from the original series at the source time points of each
resampled block. This reveals how the bootstrap combines observations from
different regime-certainty periods.

# Run HMM bootstrap with diagnostics

                        show_probabilities = TRUE, 
                        probability_style = "line")
