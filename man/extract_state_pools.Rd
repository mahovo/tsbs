\usage{
extract_state_pools(fit, y, state_info)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An MSGARCH fit object.}

\item{y}{Numeric vector, the original data.}

\item{state_info}{Output from \code{extract_msgarch_states}.}
}
\value{
A list of length \code{n_states}, where each element contains:
\describe{
\item{indices}{Integer vector of time indices assigned to this state.}
\item{n}{Integer, count of observations in this state.}
\item{proportion}{Numeric, proportion of total observations.}
}
}
\description{
Builds pools of time indices for each regime based on Viterbi decoding.
These pools are used for synchronized sampling in the bootstrap procedure.
}
\details{
For multivariate bootstrap with synchronized sampling, we sample entire
time indices (not individual residuals) from each state pool. This preserves
the cross-sectional dependence structure that existed at each time point.
