  x,
  n_boot = NULL,
  block_length = NULL,
  num_blocks = NULL,
  num_boots = 20L,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix with rows representing time points and columns representing variables.}

\item{num_boots}{Number of bootstrap replicates to generate.}

\item{block_type}{Character. Either \code{"moving"} (Moving Block Bootstrap) or
\code{"stationary"} (Stationary Bootstrap).}

\item{p}{Probability parameter for the geometric block length (used in Stationary Bootstrap).}

\item{overlap}{Logical. If \code{FALSE}, stationary blocks are chosen from
non-overlapping segments.}

\item{n_length_spec}{Integer or \code{NA}. Desired number of time points in the bootstrap sample.
If \code{NA}, the original series length is used.}

\item{block_length_spec}{Integer or \code{NA}. Length of each block.
If \code{NA}, a heuristic is used based on the average lag-1 autocorrelation across variables.}

\item{num_blocks_spec}{Integer or \code{NA}. Number of blocks to use.
If \code{NA}, this is inferred from \code{n_length_spec}.}
}
\value{
A list of matrices, each one a bootstrap replicate with dimensions approximately
\code{n_length_spec} Ã— \code{ncol(x)}.
}
\description{
Generates bootstrap replicates of a multivariate time series using either the
Moving Block Bootstrap (MBB) or Stationary Bootstrap (SB) methods.
Not intended to be called directly by user, only to be called internally by
tsbs().
}
\details{
The Moving Block Bootstrap (MBB) resamples fixed-length overlapping blocks
from the original time series. The Stationary Bootstrap (SB) samples
blocks with geometrically distributed lengths and can optionally enforce
non-overlap constraints.

If \code{block_length_spec} is \code{NA}, an automatic heuristic is used that depends
on the average lag-1 autocorrelation across variables. The function
supports flexible specifications of output length (\code{n_length_spec}) and
block structure (\code{num_blocks_spec}).

\examples{
set.seed(123)
x <- matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 1)
boots <- blockBootstrap(x, block_type = "stationary", num_boots = 5)
dim(boots[[1]])
