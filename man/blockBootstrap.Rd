}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix with rows representing time points and columns
representing variables.}

\item{bs_type}{Character. Bootstrap type. Either \code{"moving"} (Moving Block
Bootstrap) or \code{"stationary"} (Stationary Bootstrap).}

\item{block_type}{Character. Block type. Either \code{"non-overlapping"},
\code{"overlapping"} or \code{"tapered"}.}

\item{taper_type}{Tapering window function. Character. One of \code{"cosine"},
\code{"bartlett"}, or \code{"tukey"}.}

\item{num_boots}{Number of bootstrap replicates to generate.}

\item{p}{Probability parameter for the geometric block length (used in
Stationary Bootstrap).}

\item{stationary_max_percentile}{Stationary max percentile.}

\item{stationary_max_fraction_of_n}{Stationary max fraction of n.}

\item{n_length_spec}{Integer or \code{NA}. Desired number of time points in the
bootstrap sample. If \code{NA}, the original series length is used.}

\item{block_length_spec}{Integer or \code{NA}. Length of each block. If \code{NA}, a
heuristic is used based on the average lag-1 autocorrelation across variables.}

\item{num_blocks_spec}{Integer or \code{NA}. Number of blocks to use. If \code{NA},
this is inferred from \code{n_length_spec}.}

\item{overlap}{Logical. If \code{FALSE}, stationary blocks are chosen from
non-overlapping segments.}
}
\value{
A list of matrices, each one a bootstrap replicate with dimensions
approximately \code{n_length_spec} Ã— \code{ncol(x)}.
}
\description{
Generates bootstrap replicates of a multivariate time series using either the
Moving Block Bootstrap (MBB) or Stationary Bootstrap (SB) methods.
Not intended to be called directly by user, only to be called internally by
tsbs().
}
\details{
The Moving Block Bootstrap (MBB) resamples fixed-length overlapping blocks
from the original time series. The Stationary Bootstrap (SB) samples
blocks with geometrically distributed lengths and can optionally enforce
non-overlap constraints.

If \code{block_length_spec} is \code{NA}, an automatic heuristic is used that depends
on the average lag-1 autocorrelation across variables. The function
supports flexible specifications of output length (\code{n_length_spec}) and
block structure (\code{num_blocks_spec}).

set.seed(123)
