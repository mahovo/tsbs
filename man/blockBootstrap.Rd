\title{Block Bootstrap for Time Series (Rcpp Implementation)}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix with rows representing time points and columns representing variables.}

\item{n_length}{Integer. Desired number of time points in the bootstrap sample. If \code{-1}, uses the original series length.}

\item{block_length}{Integer. Length of each block. If \code{-1}, a default is computed based on the lag-1 autocorrelation of the series.}

\item{num_blocks}{Optional number of blocks to use instead of setting \code{n_length}.}

\item{num_boots}{Number of bootstrap replicates to generate.}

\item{block_type}{Character. Type of block bootstrap: either \code{"moving"} (Moving Block Bootstrap) or \code{"stationary"} (Stationary Bootstrap).}

\item{p}{Probability parameter for the geometric distribution (used in Stationary Bootstrap).}

\item{overlap}{Logical. If \code{FALSE}, stationary blocks are chosen from non-overlapping segments.}
}
\value{
A list of matrices, each one a bootstrap replicate with dimensions approximately \verb{n_length Ã— ncol(x)}.
}
\description{
Generates bootstrap replicates of a multivariate time series using either the
Moving Block Bootstrap (MBB) or Stationary Bootstrap (SB) methods.
}
\details{
The Moving Block Bootstrap (MBB) resamples fixed-length overlapping blocks from the original time series.
The Stationary Bootstrap (SB) samples blocks with geometrically distributed lengths and can optionally avoid overlap.

If \code{block_length} is set to \code{-1}, an automatic heuristic is used that depends on the average lag-1 autocorrelation across variables.
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
x <- matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 1)
boots <- blockBootstrap(x, block_type = "stationary", num_boots = 5)
dim(boots[[1]])
