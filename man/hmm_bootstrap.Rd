\description{
Fits a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to a multivariate time series
and generates bootstrap replicates by resampling regime-specific blocks.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
\item Fits a Gaussian HMM to \code{x} using \code{depmixS4::depmix()} and
\code{depmixS4::fit()}.
\item Uses Viterbi decoding (\code{posterior(fit, type = "viterbi")$state})
to assign each observation to a state.
\item Samples contiguous blocks of observations belonging to each state.
}
If \code{n_boot} is set, the last block will be truncated when necessary to match
the length (\code{n_boot}) of the bootstrap series. This is the only way to
ensure equal length of all bootstrap series, as the length of each block is
random. If \code{n_boot} is not set, \code{num_blocks} must be set, and the length of
each bootstrap series will be determined by the number of blocks and the
random lengths of the individual blocks for that particular series. This
almost certainly results in bootstrap series of different lengths.
For multivariate series (matrices or data frames), the function fits a single
HMM where all variables are assumed to depend on the same underlying hidden
state sequence. The returned bootstrap samples are matrices with the same
number of columns as the input \code{x}.
