\title{Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Bootstrap for Time Series}
\usage{
hmm_bootstrap(
  x,
  n_boot = NULL,
  num_states = 2,
  num_blocks = 100,
  num_boots = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector representing the time series.}

\item{n_boot}{Length of bootstrap series.}

\item{num_states}{Integer number of hidden states for the HMM.}

\item{num_blocks}{Integer number of blocks to sample for each bootstrap replicate.}

\item{num_boots}{Integer number of bootstrap replicates to generate.}
}
\value{
A list of numeric vectors, each one a bootstrap replicate.
}
\description{
Fits a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to a univariate time series
and generates bootstrap replicates by resampling regime-specific blocks.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
\item Fits a Gaussian HMM to \code{x} using \code{depmixS4::depmix()} and \code{depmixS4::fit()}.
\item Uses Viterbi decoding (\code{posterior(fit, type = "viterbi")$state})
to assign each observation to a state.
\item Samples contiguous blocks of observations belonging to each state.
}
If \code{n_boot} is set, the last block will be truncated when necessary to match
the length (\code{n_boot}) of the bootstrap series. This is the only way to
ensure equal length of all bootstrap series, as the length of each block is
random. If \code{n_boot} is not set, \code{num_blocks} must be set, and the length of
each bootstrap series will be determined by the number of blocks and the
random lengths of the individual blocks for that particular series. Note
that this almost certainly results in bootstrap series of different lengths.

\examples{
set.seed(123)
x <- arima.sim(n = 200, list(ar = 0.5))
hmm_samples <- hmm_bootstrap(x, num_states = 2, num_blocks = 10, num_boots = 5)
length(hmm_samples)     # 5 bootstrap replicates
length(hmm_samples[[1]]) # length of one bootstrap series
