\description{
Computes standard errors for GOGARCH component GARCH parameters.
GOGARCH differs from DCC/CGARCH in that it uses ICA decomposition followed
by univariate GARCH on independent components. SE computation focuses on
the component-level GARCH parameters.
}
\details{
GOGARCH models the observation vector as: Y = A * S, where S contains
independent components each following univariate GARCH. The log-likelihood
decomposes as:
\deqn{LL = \sum_i LL_i(S_i; \theta_i) + \log|det(K)|}

Standard errors are computed independently for each component's GARCH
parameters using the component-wise Hessian. This is justified by the
independence assumption of ICA.

Note: SEs for the ICA mixing matrix A are not provided as A is typically
treated as a fixed transformation after ICA estimation.
